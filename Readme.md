# R, Python and Mathematica Codes in Data Science

<b> Welcome to my GitHub repo. </b>

I am a Data Scientist and I code in R, Python and Wolfram Mathematica. Here you will find some Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence models I developed.

<b> Outputs of the models can be seen at my portfolio: </b> https://www.slideshare.net/RubensZimbres/portfolio-82-2017
